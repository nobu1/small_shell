# small_shell

A minimal Unix-like shell implemented in C.

## Overview

**small_shell** is a simple command-line shell, written in C, that mimics the basic functionality of popular Unix shells. It is designed for learning and experimentation, making it a great resource for those interested in operating systems, process management, and command parsing.

## Features

- Custom shell prompt
- Execution of external commands (searches `$PATH`)
- Built-in commands:
  - `cd`
  - `pwd`
  - `echo`
  - `export`
  - `unset`
  - `env`
  - `exit`
- Input/output redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`)
- Pipes (`|`) for command chaining
- Environment variable expansion (e.g., `$HOME`)
- Basic error handling

## Getting Started
